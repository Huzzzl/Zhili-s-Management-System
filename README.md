# Zhili-s-Management-System

This is a simple information management system. The system's front-end UI interface was designed. The functions implemented include adding, modifying, deleting user information, searching for user information, and adjusting the amount of information displayed on the page.

The project uses Vue framework and ElementUI framework on the front end, SpringBoot framework on the back end, and uses the non-relational database Redis to link the database.
